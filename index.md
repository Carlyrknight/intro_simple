# NYU Introduction to Sociology Newspaper
## Fall 2020

Welcome to our class's Final Project, a newspaper devoted to social problems. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Carlyrknight/intro_simple/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### News articles

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Reviews

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Carlyrknight/intro_simple/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
